# MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection Using TensorFlow

## Project goal

This project focuses on building, tuning, and evaluating a deep learning model to accurately detect whether a person has a brain tumor, and if so, to classify the type of tumor.

## Recent updates:

Currently, I'm working on the following branch: [More tuning](https://github.com/dabokva/Tumor_Detection_MRI/tree/more_tuning)
